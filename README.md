This data science project, conducted at UCSD, explores the relationship between calories and average recipe ratings. Using a dataset of thousands of recipes and user interactions, I built a baseline linear regression model that predicts recipe ratings based on calories and whether a recipe is tagged as healthy.

# Introduction
The dataset used for this project contains recipes and ratings from [food.com](https://food.com/) posted since 2008. This dataset was originally scraped and used in the paper, [Generating Personalized Recipes from Historical User Preferences](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/emnlp19c.pdf), by Majumder et al.

The `recipe` dataset contains 83782 unique recipes. The following information is given for each recipe:
